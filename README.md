# To Do

This simple Todo app allows users to add tasks and remove them. The tasks are displayed in an unordered list, and each task has a "Remove" button to delete it. The tasks are stored in the browsers local storage so they are still persistent if the user reloads the page. The user can choose the theme of the page from a theme picker and they can also toggle between dark to light mode. Initially dark mode is selected first.
